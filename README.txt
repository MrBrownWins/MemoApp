The MemoChat was created from scratch by the authors. The application has friendlier user interface.
Login activity is designed in totally different way than given design.
In login there are 2 types of registration by email and phone.
All forms are  validated, it asks to enter valid email address and password.
In user listing activity and chat activity recyclerView was used.
When user is logged in and close the application and opens the application again application does not ask to login,
it saves user data and automatically goes to UserListActivity. In chat activity we did not used to simple button,
we used actionSend button. The application also contains small memo in the memo activity.
The User listing activity contains search function, users can be searched by user name. Users can sign out.
Used Libraries: ButterKnife, Cardview, Recyclerview, firebase-messaging, firebase-auth, firebase-database.
